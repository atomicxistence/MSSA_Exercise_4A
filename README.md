### Space Trucker

This project was a pair programming project that was completed over a two week period, for the [Microsoft Software & Systems Academy](https://military.microsoft.com/programs/mssa/) course. The purpose was to learn to design and code as part of a small team.

Our objective was to create an engaging game experience that can be expanded upon easily with new components as we move forward.  We planned to use the MVVM methodology to create the modular components. This would also allow some autonomous development while not in class together. Designing the program in a way that we can interface with each other's components.
