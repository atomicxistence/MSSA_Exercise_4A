# MSSA Exercise 4A
> Create a console based space trader game prototype

This project is a pair programming project that is scheduled for a two week period. The purpose is to learn to design and code as part of a small team.

Our objective is to create an engaging game experience that can be expanded upon easily with new components as we move forward.  We plan to use the MVVM methodology to create the modular components. This will also allow some autonomous development while not in class together. Designing the program in a way that we can interface with each other's components.
