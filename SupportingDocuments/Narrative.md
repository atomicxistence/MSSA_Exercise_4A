# Space Trucker

The universe was made a much smaller place once faster than light travel became possible.  Trading planetary ores is a lucrative business and the Weyland Consortium is the universal leader.

Weyland contracts automated galactic truckers to trade and transport their interests through the most hostile trade routes. Each pilot is outfitted with cutting edge AI, learning and adapting to the changing universal economy. 

These pilots are designed to last for only 50 years. Only the most profitable pilots are refitted into new ships, the rest are scrapped...
